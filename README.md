# hello-world

Hello there,
I am 20 years old and finally delving into programming... an great idea followed by great execution allows individuals to tranform the tech era. Understanding computers is in my opinion one of the largest assets to know in this era. I have committed myself to 100 hours of working on myself per week. Git hub will be my meter of performance. From basic programs to full fledged ones. For my first language to be using I will use python.
